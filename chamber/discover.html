                <h3>History and Heritage</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Originally, Boksburg was laid out in 1887 to serve the surrounding gold mines, and named
                    after the
                    State Secretary of the South African Republic, Eduard Bok. The Main Reef Road linked
                    Boksburg to all
                    the other major mining towns on the Witwatersrand and the Angelo Hotel was used as a
                    production
                    post.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Discover Boksburg's captivating attractions by exploring our Theme Park (Gold Reef City), the
                    City of
                    Gold Mines is the largest theme amusement park and leisure entertainment center in
                    South Africa. The city of gold mines is themed around the Witwatersrand Gold Rush. The
                    employees in
                    the theme park are dressed in the costumes of gold diggers from the 1880s, and the design of
                    the
                    park is also imitating the style of that era. There are many free-range peacocks strolling
                    leisurely
                    in the park, passing by from time to time. The theme park is surrounded by hotels,
                    entertainment
                    venues, restaurants, children's museums, 4D cinemas, and a journey into a gold mine. The
                    mines of
                    the Golden City were dug to a depth of 3,200 meters underground, and now tourists can go
                    down to 220
                    meters underground to see the actual operation of gold mining at that time. Also see the
                    actual
                    melting of gold and the process of casting gold coins.</p>
