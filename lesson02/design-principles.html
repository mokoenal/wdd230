                <p>White space is one of the 13 basic design principles and refers to any blank or empty space
                    surrounding
                    all the other elements in a design composition. It is the space between text, images, buttons and
                    other
                    objects that a user can see on a page or a screen.</p>

                <p>The Rule of Thirds is a type of off-center composition where important elements of a photograph are
                    placed along a 3×3 grid, which equally divides the image into nine parts. For many photographers,
                    this
                    type of composition is a basic way to give structure to photographs and make them more appealing.
                    With
                    the rule of thirds, photographers envision four lines across their photographs, which also creates
                    four
                    intersecting points./p>

                <p>Alignment in design refers to the arrangement of elements along a common axis or grid to create
                    visual
                    harmony and order. This principle serves to improve the composition’s readability and cohesiveness.
                    In
                    visual mediums like graphics or web design, you may see alignment in action when text, images, and
                    other
                    elements are lined up consistently along margins or other guide lines. In writing, alignment can be
                    observed when text is uniformly justified to the left or right, or perhaps centered, making the
                    content
                    easier to follow and more visually pleasing for the reader.</p>
